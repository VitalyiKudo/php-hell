                                weather conditions, mechanical breakdown, strikes or labor problems, or

                                shall prevent, delay or interrupt the furnishing or operation or performance of
                                such transportation.

                    <p>
                        In the event of any such occurrence, JetOnset will use commercially reasonable efforts
                        to provide other aircraft to meet Client’s scheduled flight. JetOnset shall not be
                        responsible or liable for the transportation of passengers who fail to report at the
                        specified Fixed Based Operator (FBO) at the departure airport, at the departure time of
                        the flight, or who are, through no fault of JetOnset, not aboard at the time of departure.
                        If one or more members of one group fail to so report or board, Carrier may depart as
                        scheduled and Carrier and/or JetOnset shall in no way be responsible for or to Client or
                        such individual for any damages and JetOnset shall be deemed to have completed its
                        contractual obligation to Client. JetOnset

                        OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY (A) CONSEQUENTIAL,
                        INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR RELIANCE
                        DAMAGES; (B) AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE PRICE PAID FOR A PARTICULAR

                        performed by Carrier. Carrier shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of any
                        and all occurrences, accidents or incidents that occur on or in connection with the
                        aircraft operated by Carrier, including, without limitation, all personal injuries, property
                        damage or death. JetOnset is not responsible for any wrongful, or negligent act or
                        omission by Carrier or its personnel and is not responsible for any personal injury,
                        property damage, accident, delay, inconvenience, or change in itinerary that may occur.

                        These limitations shall apply notwithstanding the failure of the essential purpose of any
                        limited remedy. Client agrees that Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
                        JetOnset and JetOnset officers, directors, agents and employees, and each of them
                        (collectively the “Indemnitee(s)”) from and against all claims, suits, actions, judgments,
                        fines, penalties, damages, losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to third party
                        claims and reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs of litigation, and other expenses relating
                        thereto, including the cost of establishing the right of indemnification under this
                        Agreement, which arise out of or are in connection with activities associated with this
                        Agreement, which are made, asserted, assessed, or accrued against any Indemnitee by
                        reason of injury or death to any person or the loss or damage to any real or personal
                        property. The foregoing indemnities shall not apply to the extent of any gross negligence
                        or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee.
